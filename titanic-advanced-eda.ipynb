However, one would be more accurate in imputing Nan ages by calculating mean age of a group of *similar passengers*. For example, one could choose to calculate mean of Pclass 1 passengers and assign it to all Pclass 1 missing ages, and likeways for Pclass 2 and Pclass 3. But we can further improvise on this. It quite likely that females on Pclass 3 have a different mean age than females on Pclass 1. So, an even better approach is to group people based on Sex+Pclass.\n","\n","Yet, it is impossible to tell between a child and an adult based solely on Sex+Pclass and since we have seen that children have a much better chance of surviving than adults, it'd improve our predictions if we could identify children. Fortunately, for male children, their Title contains the 'Master' prefix which we can use to identify male children. We identify 8 male children with missing ages all of which traveled in Pclass 3 and the mean age of male children of Pclass 3 is 5.35. So, 5 is a good average Age for these 8 boys.\n","\n","Before we update the values for these 8 kids, let us do a quick sanity check. We know that these kids should ideally have non-zero Parch i.e. these small kids should not be travelling alone but travelling with at least 1 parent!"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":47,"id":"1a95f8be","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-25T10:22:41.782168Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-25T10:22:41.781678Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-25T10:22:41.799724Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-25T10:22:41.799221Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.110485,"end_time":"2022-04-25T10:22:41.801323","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-25T10:22:41.690838","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>PassengerId</th>\n","      <th>Survived</th>\n","      <th>Pclass</th>\n","      <th>Name</th>\n","      <th>Sex</th>\n","      <th>Age</th>\n","      <th>SibSp</th>\n","      <th>Parch</th>\n","      <th>Ticket</th>\n","      <th>Fare</th>\n","      <th>Cabin</th>\n","      <th>Embarked</th>\n","      <th>FamilySize</th>\n","      <th>PeopleInTicket</th>\n","      <th>FarePerPerson</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>65</th>\n","      <td>66</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>Moubarek, Master.
